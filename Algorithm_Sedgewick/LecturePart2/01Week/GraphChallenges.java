public class GraphChallenges {
	// 1. Is a graph bipartite? - Use DFS, little difficult.
	// 2. Find a cycle. - Use DFS, Easy.
	// The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.
	// all vertices have even degree -> Euler tour possible.
	// 3. Euler tour(use every edge exactly once) - little difficult.
	// 4. Hamilton tour(use every vertex exactly once) - intractable
	// traveling salesman problem
	// 5. Are two graphs identical except for vertex names?(Graph isomorphism) - No one knows.
	// 6. Lay out a graph in the plane without crossing edges?(planarity) - DFS, Hire an expert.
