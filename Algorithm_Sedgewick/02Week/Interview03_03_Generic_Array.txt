Q3.
Java generics. Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

sol)
When creating an array in Java, you use the new operator.
The new operator allocates memory after checking whether there is enough memory in the heap area.
However, at the time of compilation, it is not possible to know what the generic type is,
so memory allocation cannot be performed.
Therefore, you cannot create a generic array.
